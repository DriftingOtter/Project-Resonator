## 🎧 Philosophy & Reasoning

> I fell in love with IEMs, so I decided "why not, I'm bored."

## ❓ *Can I Use These Files To Build My Own IEM?*

Absolutely. I’ve set the license to be lenient for anyone who wants to use this as a base for their own commercial projects—while still keeping that open-source spirit that I’ve grown to love in the comp sci world.

I hope this gives you a head start—maybe even helps you dodge some of the mistakes I made.

*Reminder: I’m still human, and this design is far from perfect—but it should give you a solid look at what an IEM build process can look like.*

## 📶 Bluetooth Audio Module Tool (FSC-BT6038)

A new addition to Project Resonator is a Bluetooth control tool that interfaces with the FSC-BT6038 module using AT commands via serial.

You can find this tool in:

```
/Project-Resonator/Bluetooth Audio Module/
```

### ⚙️ How to Run the Bluetooth Tool

1. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Project-Resonator/Bluetooth Audio Module"
   ```

2. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch the GUI tool:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### ⚠️ Warning

> This code is currently **untested**, as I am in the process of purchasing the FSC-BT6038 module. Use it at your own discretion, and validate the functionality on your setup before relying on it for critical builds.

### 📄 Official Module Documentation

Refer to the official programming documentation for the FSC-BT6038 module here:

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### VituixCAD (Archived Version) + Fixing Missing File Paths

1. Go to [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/)  
2. Paste: `https://kimmosaunisto.net/`  
3. Find and download any version before **2018-04-25**  
4. Install it and open the `.vxp` simulation file included in this project  

You’ll probably get a bunch of “missing file path” errors—don’t worry. That just means the project is still pointing to paths from my own system.

To fix:
- Click the folder icon next to the `.frd` or `.zma` file slot
- Navigate to the correct folder for each BA driver (inside the `BA Driver Spec Sheets` folder in this repo)
- Re-link the appropriate files

*(You only need to do this once.)*

### Downloading Fusion 360 IEM Shell Files

All IEM shell files are now hosted on **MEGA**. This includes both `.stl` files for direct printing and `.f3d` Fusion files for editing.

Since GitHub has upload limits, I’ve stored them externally here:

🔗 [Mega Link For IEM Shell Files](https://mega.nz/folder/2Z4WzYDR#g-NULd1YQFsHa81YXLZzIw)

Inside, you'll find:

- `Ready-To-Prints`     | Shell prototypes you can print right away  
- `Fusion-Shell-Models` | Editable Fusion files to tweak however you’d like
