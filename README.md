## üéß Philosophy & Reasoning

> I fell in love with IEMs, so I decided "why not, I'm bored."

## ‚ùì *Can I Use These Files To Build My Own IEM?*

Absolutely. I‚Äôve set the license to be lenient for anyone who wants to use this as a base for their own commercial projects‚Äîwhile still keeping that open-source spirit that I‚Äôve grown to love in the comp sci world.

I hope this gives you a head start‚Äîmaybe even helps you dodge some of the mistakes I made.

*Reminder: I‚Äôm still human, and this design is far from perfect‚Äîbut it should give you a solid look at what an IEM build process can look like.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### VituixCAD + Fixing Missing File Paths

1. Go to `https://kimmosaunisto.net/`
2. Find and download latest version
3. Install it and open the `.vxp` simulation file included in this project  

You‚Äôll probably get a bunch of ‚Äúmissing file path‚Äù errors‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry. That just means the project is still pointing to paths from my own system.

To fix:
- Click the folder icon next to the `.frd` or `.zma` file slot
- Navigate to the correct folder for each BA driver (inside the `BA Driver Spec Sheets` folder in this repo)
- Re-link the appropriate files

*(You only need to do this once.)*

### Downloading Fusion 360 IEM Shell Files

All IEM shell files are now hosted on **MEGA**. This includes both `.stl` files for direct printing and `.f3d` Fusion files for editing.

Since GitHub has upload limits, I‚Äôve stored them externally here:

üîó [Mega Link For IEM Shell Files](https://mega.nz/folder/2Z4WzYDR#g-NULd1YQFsHa81YXLZzIw)

Inside, you'll find:

- `Ready-To-Prints`     | Shell prototypes you can print right away  
- `Fusion-Shell-Models` | Editable Fusion files to tweak however you‚Äôd like
